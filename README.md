Reflection on your experience with this assignment:


I didn't work with anybody else for this assignment. I did attend office hours.


I also just had trouble keeping track of everything because there were so many details.
For example, making sure that the methods index ranges included the proper indicies, which weren't always the same, or that I included 
the correct exceptions. 
I think in the future I would make a spreadsheet when I get instructions so I can list out each of the requirements for 
each part in a very detailed checklist format so I can keep track of things better.

One thing that I completely forgot about until I looked at the checklist was trying to reduce redundancy by having methods call each other. But I'm glad that I ended up doing that because it looks a lot less messy and it's easier to read through now that
I can just call the other methods instead of writing more loops.
I should definitely read the checklist earlier, but this time, I had already written implementations of the methods before
the checklist was released so it was a bit of an odd case out.
